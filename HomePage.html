            <b id = "bold">About Me:</b><br><br>If I had to describe myself in one word it would have to be: "Passionate". I say this because everything that I do is surrounded by a sense of passion, after all, what's the point of things if you can't be excited about them? This sense of passion allows me to become attached to any tasks that I have taken on. It becomes my personal responsibility to make sure that task gets done, and that it gets done right.

            <b id = "bold">Work Experience:</b><br><br><i>JavaScript Coach, Hatch Canada</i><br>This is a job I am quite excited about. Although I have yet to start, I greatly look forward to this position because of the nature of the work.

The coaches for this position must display a solid understanding of JavaScript before they can be placed at schools.<br><br><i>Teaching Assistant, McMaster University</i><br>This is another position I have not started yet. This job will involve working closely with a professor for a Computer Science course.<br><br><i>Tech Level 1, Avtek Productions</i><br>I have held this position for over a year now. A general description can be found below:

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226; Worked closely with administration on a number of internal projects. <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226; Developed strong working relationships with both my peers and supervisors. <br>

        <p> <!-- This section covers my volunteer experience -->
            <b id = "bold">Volunteer Experience:</b><br><br><i>Welcome Week Event Leader, McMaster University</i><br>I am quite proud of this position. Two years in a row I was chosen to be a Society of Off-Campus Students (SOCS) Welcome Week representative. During my second year I applied to be an Event Leader and I was given the position. A few details of the position can be found below:
            <br><br>
            <!-- The code below is for bullet point; see comment A -->
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226; Supervised over other welcome week representatives while facing various challenges.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226; Organized large groups of representatives and first year students at large events.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226; Created deep connections with both representatives and first year students.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226; Working days averaged around 16 hours for eight full days.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226; Worked closely with upper level members of the society to ensure the events ran flawlessly.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226; Ensured any sick first year students were very well taken care of and safe.<br><br>
            I am especially proud of this position because both my peers and myself worked incredibly hard to achieve one unified goal, and we did more than that. Every event was very successful, this was shown through the very high attendance and satisfaction of the first year students. On top of that all of us developed very great relationships with the first year students. SOCS as a whole had around 120 members and we all worked closely together with minimal problems.
