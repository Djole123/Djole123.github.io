            <b id = "bold">About Me:</b><br><br>If I had to describe myself in one word it would have to be: "Passionate". I say this because everything that I do is surrounded by a sense of passion, after all, what's the point of things if you can't be excited about them? This sense of passion allows me to become attached to any tasks that I have taken on. It becomes my personal responsibility to make sure that task gets done, and that it gets done right.

            <b id = "bold">Volunteer Experience:</b><br><br><i>Welcome Week Event Leader, McMaster University</i><br>I am quite proud of this position. Two years in a row I was chosen to be a Society of Off-Campus Students (SOCS) Welcome Week representative. During my second year I applied to be an Event Leader and I was given the position. A few details of the position can be found below:
            <br><br>
            <!-- The code below is for bullet points; see comment A -->
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226; Supervised over other welcome week representatives while facing various challenges.<br>

Every event was very successful, this was shown through the very high attendance and satisfaction of the first year students. On top of that all of us developed very great relationships with the first year students. SOCS as a whole had around 120 members and we all worked closely together with minimal problems.

            <i>Arduino Workshop Lead, McMaster University</i><br>
            Recently at McMaster University a "Maker Space" was built in the basement of the Engineering library. I visited the area and one of the employees saw my interest in the technical parts of the maker space and offered me a position to lead an Arduino workshop for the entirety of Welcome Week. I am quite excited to be a part of this, as not only is it quite interesting, but I will also be given the opportunity to learn more about the Arduino. For the time being I am creating a rough outline of how I think the workshop should be run. On August 10th 2017 I will be meeting with some higher ups to finalize the plan for workshop.
