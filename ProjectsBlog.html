            <i>15/01/2017</i>&nbsp; <b>First Entry:</b><br><br> This page will be dedicated to posting regular updates on any projects that I am working on. My plan is to create another post here detailing the progress I have made with my partner Nikita Jagora on an online card game we are developing. So far the plans are to develop it in Java. This may change later. My next post will contain some rough concept sketches detailing the componenets of the game.

            <i>01/03/2017</i>&nbsp; <b>Second Entry:</b><br><br> Unfortunately the project my previous post spoke about has been on hold for a long time. School is quite busy and is eating up most of my time. I have however started a smaller scale project called Weather Report. It's a simple text based game (styled similarly to Zork). I have already finished the general look of the web application. A picture of it is shown below:<br><br>
